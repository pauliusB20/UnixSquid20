            <p class="Uns-paragraphs">Most, but not all, filesystems reside on the magnetic recording surface of a Hard Disk Drive, <br/> or HDD. HDDs are also called hard drives (because the disks are hard as opposed to floppy), disk drives, or sometimes just disks.<br/> In this
                document I will usually refer to them as disk drives or HDDs.</p>
            <p class="Uns-paragraphs">There are three basic types of disk drives that have been available over the years. <br/> These are IDE, SCSI and SATA. The primary differences between these types are with the drive’s electronic <br/> interface to the computer rather than
                with the disk itself. Although external USB disk drives are available, <br/> they are usually PATA or SATA devices in a simple enclosure with a conversion for connection to a USB interface.</p>

            <li class="Uns-list-text">IDE/PATA (Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment):<br/>These interfaces used to be very common,<br/> but they are being replaced by SATA in newer systems. As the name implies, PATA disks use a parallel interface, <br/> which means that several
                bits of are transferred at once. <br/> In Linux, PATA disks are identified as /dev/hda, /dev/hdb, and so on.<br/> Partitions are identified by numbers after the device name (e.g. /dev/hda1, /dev/hda2…).<br/><br/>The original PATA devices
                had data transfer rates of 8MB/Sec. Later versions such as Ultra ATA had data transfer rates of 16 or 32MB/s. ATA-7 has a transfer rate of up to 133MB/s. Only two devices, almost always disk drives or CD-ROM drives could be connected to
                a single IDE channel interface. As a result, many motherboards had two IDE channels so that up to four devices could be attached. The term IDE is really a misnomer as it does not distinguish one drive type from another. All PC hard drives
                are IDE, Integrated Drive Electronics, regardless of their bus type, PATA, SCSI, or SATA.</li><br/>

            <li class="Uns-list-text">SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) – a serial version of the ATA protocol. <br/> As the word serial implies, SATA is a serial bus, which mean that only one bit of data can be transferred <br/> at a time. Unlike with PATA, a single
                cable can connect only one disk to the motherboard.<br/> Most Linux SATA drivers treat SATA disks as if they were SCSI disks and name them accordingly.<br/><br/> The SATA, or Serial ATA bus has become prevalent since the early 2000’s and
                it is now difficult to find any other type of disk drive. Almost all motherboards manufactured as of this writing have four or more SATA connectors and a few motherboards have no IDE/PATA connectors at all. SATA speeds were originally
                about 150MB/s and with the advent of SATA-2, data transfer rates are 600MB/s. SATA-2 also provides better error checking and hot swap capabilities.
            </li><br/>
            <li class="Uns-list-text">SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) – a parallel interface that was once common on servers and high-end interfaces. <br/> Supports up to 8 or 16 devices per bus. In Linux, SCSI disks are identified as /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, and so on.<br/>                Partitions are identified by numbers after the device name (e.g. /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2…).<br/><br/> The SCSI, or Small Computer System Interface, was developed in the early 1980’s and was used extensively for connecting hard drives as well
                as other devices. Originally supporting data transfer rates of 5MB/s, it is now capable of supporting data rates of up to 640MB/s. Up to seven devices may be attached to a single SCSI channel, and the cable length can be significantly
                longer allowing for much more flexibility. SCSI devices are more expensive than IDE/PATA or SATA devices.
            </li><br/>
            <li class="Uns-list-text">
                USB (Universal serial bus):<br/> USB hard drives—those with real, physical rotating disks—are not really different drive types.<br/> They are generally PATA or SATA drives in an enclosure with a USB bus translator.<br/> USB Thumb drives,
                which are basically RAM, are true USB devices.
